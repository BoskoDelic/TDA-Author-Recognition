# TDA-Author-Recognition

This project is based on atricle Topological Signature of 19th Century Novelists:
Persistent Homology in Text Mining by Gholizadeh, Seyeditabari, Zadrozny: https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/2/4/33. <br />
It's purpose is to demonstrate the usage of topological data analysis as to recognize the authors of a book.

Order of execution:
* Create a folder books and add your book to it.
* Run Indexes and distances.ipynb to extract characters from a book and to calculate and save distances between them.
* Run Persistence diagram.ipynb to draw a persistence diagram of a book anCancel changesd to save it.
* Run Simplicial complex.ipynb to draw a simplicial complex of a book.
* Run Classification.ipynb to get accuracy of binary classification between authors.
